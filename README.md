# Dialogue system based on fuzzy logic and word embeddings (Reuploaded)
Proof of concept of a dialogue system of a videogame. The system would consist of a dialogue graph, a word search to allow the player to interact with a non-player character and some fuzzy logic variables to control the state of the character.

## Usage
This is not the last stable version. Ink dialogue needs to be modified with the desired questions. State values need to be set visible if desired.
